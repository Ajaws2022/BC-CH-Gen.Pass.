# Random Password Generator Built Using Javascript

This webpage contains a random passwordd generator created using vanilla Javascript. It was a great first challenge for learning Javascript as it applied a lot of the language fundamentals. Inside there are variables, functions, media queries, if statements, while statements, and a for loop. These were used to create logic that will generate a password based on user inputs of length and character types. The webpage can be reached [here](https://ajaws2022.github.io/BC-CH-Gen.Pass./). And an example image can be seen below:
